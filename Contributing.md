# So I want to contribute to the mod…
Great! We’re always happy to receive contributions from the public!    
It’s contributions like these that help us make Sayori as realistic as possible.  
But you’ll want to know the sorts of things we’re looking for…


## I found a bug, and want to let the devs know.
If you think you found a bug in the game, please open an issue.  
No bug is too small or too rare.  
Remember that if you find a bug, chances are other people will have found that bug too.  
It’s important to let us know.

## I wrote a topic, and want to include it in the mod.
Neat! Topics are always welcome suggestions.   
But you’ll need to know some ground-rules for topic contributions…

### Things we’re ***not*** looking for:
Meme content: If you submit meme-related/shitpost content, it will be rejected without consideration, and you’ll be banned from future contributions.  
You’re welcome to make pop-culture references only when necessary.

NSFW content/images: These will be deleted on-sight, and you will be banned from the repo.   
Let’s keep our girl pure.

### Sayori’s “Voice”:

She’s not just a stand-in for your own voice.  
She’s her own character, with her own dis/likes, personality, and mannerisms.  
Try to capture that when writing for her.

## I drew some art, and want to include it in the mod.
Art is a tricky one. We do ***not*** have base sprites for public use, do not ask.  
For certain things like clothes, feel free to open an issue, attach the files.  
The art team will review them to see where your submission would be best placed in the mod.

To get an idea of what we might be needing, check on the art-related issues on github.


## I made some music and want to include it.
Music is another tricky one.  
Like before, feel free to open a music-related issue on github, and attach the files for review by the team.

## I wrote some code for the game.
New game code is one of the most sought-after contributions.   
But all changes to the base game code are subject to thorough reviewing. You may be asked to explain what your code does.  
If we find anything that we deem malicious, you will be banned without warning.  
For submissions to the game code, please ensure you thoroughly bug-test, as debugging other member’s code, often takes longer than implementing it ourselves.  
Having said that, if you’re sure that you think you can help with the game code, feel free to make a Pull Request on Github.
