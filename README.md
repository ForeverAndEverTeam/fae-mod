# Forever and Ever (FAE)

_Forever & Ever_ is a mod for the free game [Doki Doki Literature Club](https://www.ddlc.moe) from [Team Salvato](http://teamsalvato.com/).

In it, you can become closer to Sayori than ever before! You have all the time in the world to build the perfect relationship with our cinnamon bun as the star of the show. At the heart of the mod, we took a mental health based approach in line with the experiences Sayori had in the original game, so we can hopefully support people by offering a source of positivity, advice, and unconditional understanding.

Currently we have a whole range of unique dialogue, questions, and games for you and Sayori to enjoy!
