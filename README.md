# Doki Doki Literature Club "Forever & Ever"  
*Note: don't clone the master branch to download the mod. Use a stable release instead!*  
  
**"Forever & Ever"** is a [Doki Doki Literature Club](http://ddlc.moe) mod providing you the ability to be alone with **Sayori**. This mod is designed like [Monika After Story](https://github.com/Monika-After-Story/MonikaModDev) but has a few differences to date, including the wonderful Sayori as the star of the show.  
## History
After the release of [Monika After Story](https://github.com/Monika-After-Story/MonikaModDev), there were a few attempts to create similar mods for other DDLC characters. But nobody had published a _proper_ mod for Sayori, despite the new abilities she got at the end of the game. As a Sayori lover, I was strongly dissatisfied by the fake ["Sayori After Story"](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLC/comments/8nviad/mod_release_sayori_after_story/) mod, so I decided to create a real one for my beloved 'doki'.  

## Features  
As of now, I am trying to implement most of the MAS features, including player questions and mini-games. The dialogue was written by me and most of them were reviwed by proofreaders and is based on the original game story as well as Sayori's character and experiences (toning down the worst character traits, although).  
  
This mod is available in multiple languages. Now you can select either English or Russian or Esperanto as a game language. I'm also planning to allow others to submit translations but as of now, I can't say for sure.
