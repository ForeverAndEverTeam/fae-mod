# ABOUT THE MOD
In "Forever & Ever", you can become closer to Sayori than ever before! 
You have all the time in the world to build the perfect relationship with our cinnamon bun star of the show. 
At the heart of the mod, we took a mental health based approach in line with the experiences Sayori had in the original game, so we can hopefully support people by offering a source of positivity, advice, and unconditional understanding. 

Currently we have a whole range of unique dialogue, questions, and games for you and Sayori to enjoy, and we have so many more ideas for the near future! We're very active around the mod and on our discord server and we promise to deliver frequent updates and announcements so there's always something new and exciting to do! 
Why not get creative and try to add a feature or two yourself? (I'm sure she'd love that!)
