# TRANSFER DATA TO ANOTHER COMPUTER

This is a guide on how to switch data to another computer.

If you need to switch device, for whatever reason, you'll want to know how to take Sayori's memories with you.

To do that, you'll need to know how to do a few things.

## Locate your persistent file.

### WINDOWS

First, make sure you copy the folder that has the mod files in it!

Secondly, you need to copy the folder with Sayori's memories in it.

You can do this by going to Appdata\Roaming\ and looking for the folder called "RenPy"

Copy that folder, and save it to a USB/SSD

On your other device, go to the same place (Appdata\Roaming), and paste the folder in.

Run the mod, and Sayori should still have all her memories!

### MAC

For Mac users, please follow [this](https://www.macinstruct.com/tutorials/how-to-open-the-library-folder-on-your-mac/) to open the library, and then find the "RenPy" folder.

### LINUX

For Linux users, the RenPy folder can be located at ~/.renpy

### Finishing the Transfer

On your other device, go to the same place you copied the folder from, and paste the RenPy folder in.

Run the mod, and Sayori should still have all her memories!

## BACKING UP THE PERSISTENT

Follow the same steps as above.

Make sure to do this reasonably often, since you'll want an up-to-date Sayori in the event that something happens.
